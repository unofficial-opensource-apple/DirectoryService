	<!-- DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE ---- APPLE USE ONLY
		 permissions are modeled after system ACL design, relevant notes:
			explicit entries are processed before generic entries
			stops at first presence of an ACL
			explicit allow only, no concept of Deny
			if an explicit ACL is defined, controls apply based on authenticated users, anonymous access is not implicit based
				(i.e., just cause user requested as UUID X, doesn't mean they have automatic privilege, they must authenticate
				 to Open Directory)
			_unknown (UUID ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000063) is used to note anonymous access (i.e., allowing unauthenticated)
				to do something regardless if authenticated
			everyone (UUID ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000000C) is used as expected, to denote any authenticated user to do the
				operation
